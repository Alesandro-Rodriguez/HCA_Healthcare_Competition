## Overview
Our mission is to enhance patient assistance through optimized resource allocation, emergency preparedness, and disaster relief, ensuring timely, equitable, and efficient care.

During natural disasters, patient care is affected due to inadequate resource allocation and uneven workforce distribution across HCA facilities. The plan aims to improve emergency response and resource management.
